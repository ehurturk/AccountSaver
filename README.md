# AccountSaver
A console program that is an account saver program. It is built in Python 3.7.

You can search or add an account, also you can clear all the accounts saved in the data file.

The data file's path is "/Users/USERNAME/Dev/Projects/Logs/accounts.json" **

To save the latest account's password to your clipboard, you should use the package pyperclip, which you can download with:

`pip3 install pyperclip`, or `pip install pyperclip`

** You need to manually create those folders, in the upcoming version I'll handle it automatically.

To open the program, you need to type:

- `python3Â [your pytohn version] testingpurposes.py`to your terminal
